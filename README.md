# Recommender Systems with Generative Retrieval

This repository provides an external PyTorch implementation of the TIGER model. The original approach is introduced in the NeurIPS ’23 paper **“Recommender Systems with Generative Retrieval”** by Shashank Rajput, Nikhil Mehta, Anima Singh, Raghunandan H. Keshavan, Trung Vu, Lukasz Heldt, Lichan Hong, Yi Tay, Vinh Q. Tran, Jonah Samost, Maciej Kula, Ed H. Chi, and Maheswaran Sathiamoorthy.

## Datasets

This repository includes processed data for the Beauty dataset to run experiments immediately. For other datasets (Sports and Toys), please download the preprocessed data from: [https://zenodo.org/records/17351848](https://zenodo.org/records/17351848)

The dataset structure includes the following files for each domain:
```
data/
├── Beauty/
│   ├── Beauty_5.json
│   ├── content_embeddings.pkl
│   ├── index_rqkmeans.json
│   ├── index_rqvae.json
│   └── inter.json
├── Sport/
│   ├── content_embeddings.pkl
│   ├── index_rqkmeans.json
│   ├── index_rqvae.json
│   ├── inter.json
│   └── Sports_and_Outdoors_5.json
└── Toys/
    ├── content_embeddings.pkl
    ├── index_rqkmeans.json
    ├── index_rqvae.json
    ├── inter.json
    └── Toys_and_Games_5.json
```

Metadata JSON files are not included and precomputed content embeddings are provided for all datasets.

If you want to work with raw data from the Amazon Review dataset, download `reviews_Beauty_5.json.gz` and `meta_Beauty.json.gz` from [https://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon/productGraph/categoryFiles/](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon/productGraph/categoryFiles/), and place them in `data/Beauty/` as `Beauty_5.json` and `metadata.json`. All data processing and preparation scripts are available in the `notebooks` folder.

## Requirements

In order to launch our implementation install the following packages (tested versions in parentheses):

```bash
pip install murmurhash  # (==1.0.13)
pip install numpy  # (==2.1.2)
pip install tensorboard  # (==2.20.0)
pip install torch  # (==2.6.0+cu126)
pip install transformers  # (==4.50.3)
```

## Usage

**Important:** Execute all commands from the `tiger/tiger` directory (not from the project root).

**Training SASRec:**
```bash
python ./train_sasrec.py --params ./configs/sasrec_train_config.json
```

**Training TIGER:**
```bash
python ./train_tiger.py --params ./configs/tiger_train_config.json
```

## Reproducibility

Because there is no official TIGER reference implementation, we compare on Beauty against the results reported in ["Learnable Item Tokenization for Generative Recommendation"](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07314). Results for Yelp and Instruments will be added later. It is also noticable that SasRec is underperforms on this dataset. We are currently investigating this.

## Results

Following the original setup, we report NDCG (N) and Hit Rate (H) with @5, @10, and additionaly @20 cutoffs.

## Implementation Differences

The original paper states “Overall, the model has around 13 million parameters.” Our implementation currently has approximately 2.5× fewer parameters (~5M vs. ~13M), which is the primary architectural discrepancy. It remains to be determined which components are under‑parameterized in our implementation.

### Minor Differences:

Also, in our implementation there are some other differences.

- **Constant learning rate**: a fixed LR is used for the entire training; no scheduler is applied. With an initial LR of 0.01 and inverse square‑root decay, we observed instability during first 10k steps and inferior convergence compared with a fixed LR.

- **Early Stopping**: training stops if the validation metric (NDCG@20) does not improve for 40 epochs; this consistently yielded the strongest checkpoints in our runs.

- **LLaMA 7B inference for content embeddings**: we use a LLaMA‑7B checkpoint for content‑based embeddings instead of a T5 checkpoint as in the original work. We plan to evaluate T5 later as well.

## Future Work

We plan to investigate these implementation differences more thoroughly and address the following:

- Add a coverage metric to the evaluation protocol
- Add [LETTER](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07314) and [PLUM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07784v1) implementations.
- Add more datasets (e.g.: Yelp, Instruments, Books)
- Fine-tune hyperparameters to achieve the best performance metrics
- Add a decoder-only variant of the TIGER model
- Conduct ablation studies on the impact of different tokenization methods (RQ-VAE vs RQ-Kmeans)
